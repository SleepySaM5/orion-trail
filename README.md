# Orion Trail

This is a very simple game, based loosely on Oregon Trail (1971).

## Description
The premise of the game is simple: your explorer spaceship missed a hyperjump and you need to navigate it to the next hyperjump station safely. You need to manage your resources, so your crew survives. On each day you are presented with a situation. According to how you reacted to that situation your resources change. Should one of your resources reach 0, you lose the game.
